				<p>This project was done as part of my MSc in Artificial Intelligence course taken in the University of
					Limerick.
					It aimed to:
				<ul>
					<li>Refactor existing Music Style Transfer methods using updated libraries</li>
					<li>Define experiments using different methods of data preprocessing</li>
					<li>Evaluate each model under the various experimental conditions</li>
					<li>Benchmark the models</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h2 class="major">Abstract</h2>
				<p>While still in its infancy, the field of Music Style Transfer has seen various approaches to solving
					the problem of converting a piece of music from one genre to another.
					From variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks to supervised learning methods,
					researchers have had some success in solving this problem, yet due to the subjective nature of the
					field, there is no consensus on how to compare the results of the various models.
					Added to this, is the fact that some of the models have not been maintained and use deprecated
					libraries, making them harder to assess.
					In this dissertation, we refactor the existing code base of two existing models and use different
					approaches for processing the data, while maintaining model architecture frozen, and evaluate their
					performance using metrics proposed by newly published research.
					The results allow us to draw insight into the approaches that generates better results of music
					style transfer.
